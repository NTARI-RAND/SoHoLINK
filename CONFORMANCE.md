# Conformance — Janus-Facing Architecture

The repo's self-description in the architecture's own terms, stated **before** anything product- or deployment-specific, per the architecture's ordering rule. Every conformance claim is bound to the mechanism and check that enforces it, or it is labeled a stand-in. Unbound prose is marketing.

The architecture is **Janus-Facing Architecture (JFA)** — NTARI's unified architecture document, free documentation under the project's AGPL-3.0 commons. It names roles, never products; this repo declares which role it fills.

## Role declaration

SoHoLINK is the **coordinator** of a JFA **substrate**: node-side orchestration — node recognition via capability listings, matching and scheduling, the employment lifecycle, fee declarations, fiat settlement, dispute handling — and federation of front ends. The coordinator is a **pluggable role**: any conformant implementation may replace it, and a front end may run its own or match directly against nodes. The substrate guarantee it serves: **coordination on infrastructure participants can own — no unremovable hosting chokepoint.**

| This repo's term | Architecture role |
|---|---|
| Coordinator (this repo) | the coordinator: node-side orchestration, pluggable, replaceable |
| Frontend (Cloudy et al.) | a front end: the member-facing application; where members and the member economy live |
| Node | participant-owned infrastructure |
| `participants` table, portal, agent | **transitional member surfaces** — front-end-owned capabilities hosted here pending migration, labeled as such in CLAUDE.md |

## Invariants and their bindings

| Invariant (architecture) | Mechanism here | Check |
|---|---|---|
| **Persons never appear on the wire** | Long-term the coordinator models no persons: counterparties are front ends and nodes; wire identity is workload identity (SPIFFE NodeID) via `sohocloud-protocol` | Protocol consumed at published tag; transitional person-surfaces labeled, not denied |
| **Single participant identity** | One `participants` table (migration 011) — no provider/consumer split exists in the schema or code | Schema; grep for `providers`/`consumers` returns only the migration history |
| **Fee legibility** | Fees exist only as coordinator-signed `FeeDeclaration` messages — authored, legible, contestable | Protocol `fees/` package + SPEC |
| **Fiat stays fiat; credit stays home** | Settlement is pure fiat (Stripe Connect); no tokens, no wallets; strictly separate from any front end's member-issued credit | CLAUDE.md invariant; payment package touches Stripe only |
| **No information asymmetry** | Pricing, metering, and earnings visible to all participants | Portal surfaces; metering tables |
| **Governance surface separated** | Admin portal on a separate local-only port, never exposed publicly, not role-flags on the public portal | Deploy configuration |
| **Provenance inbound = outbound** | AGPL-3.0; DCO (`Signed-off-by` per commit), no CLA | License; DCO workflow (see stand-ins: enforcement suspended as a named interim) |

## Stand-ins and open residuals

- **Transitional member surfaces.** The node agent, member portal, `participants` table, and installer are front-end-owned capabilities hosted here from the dual-role era, pending migration. They are labeled, kept working, and never described as the coordinator's long-term role.
- **Coordinator federation is a design target, not built.** Witnessed checkpoints (the certificate-transparency model reserved in the record layer and the protocol's `anchor/` stub) are the named target for cross-coordinator non-equivocation. Until then, this is a single-coordinator deployment: the architecture's open problem 7 — sovereign compute buys mechanical, not economic, exit — applies in full and is named, not solved.
- **Frontend-as-operator authentication — BUILT on the coordination wire.** The `/v0` node-side surface and node-pubkey enrollment now accept a 2-of-7 operator transmission (rotating seven-key set, `X-SohoCloud-Operator` header, per-`(operator,coordinator)` replay window) via an operator-or-SPIFFE selector: the header selects the operator path; its absence keeps the existing SPIFFE path for direct/satellite nodes. Node authenticity in both paths comes from each message's own ed25519 signature (verified against `node_protocol_keys`), so the operator-relay path adds no per-node SVID. Check: `OperatorAuth`/`OperatorOrSPIFFE` unit tests; conformance harness Suite B. Residual: no operator has completed enrollment end-to-end yet (blocked on the 2FA mail transport), so the path is verified in test, not yet in production.
- **Fiat settlement counterparty** (member's payout identity vs. front end) is a deliberately open question; either answer stays fiat-side, never conflated with member credit.
- **DCO enforcement is suspended as a named interim (2026-07-12).** The `dco.yml` workflow is disabled — not deleted — for the stack-establishment push, by decision of the steward. Per the architecture's provenance standard: the covenant itself never suspends (contributions still enter the AGPL commons inbound = outbound, Contributor Covenant unaffected); reinstatement is committed and is one action (`gh workflow enable DCO`); and the gap is honest — commits made during the window cannot be retroactively certified, so the window is kept short and its start and end are matters of record. Agent-authored commits continue to carry `Signed-off-by` throughout the window regardless.

## Dependency declaration

Consumes `sohocloud-protocol` at a published version tag — the dependency leaf both this coordinator and the front ends share. Depends on no front end and no member-economy code; the member economy lives above this layer and must not migrate down into it.

## Product-specific notes (last, per the ordering rule)

Reference deployment at soholink.org; trust domain `spiffe://soholink.org`. Cloudy is the reference front end. Neither is privileged by the protocol.
